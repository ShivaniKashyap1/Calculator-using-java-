Calculator using java
This Scientific Calculator is a Java-based desktop application that performs a wide range of mathematical operations, both basic and advanced. Built using the Java Swing library, the calculator provides an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that includes buttons for numbers, operators, and functions, allowing users to perform calculations with ease.
